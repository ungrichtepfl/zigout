# zigout

Small game in [ZIG](https://ziglang.org/). Followed [tsodings stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIX9zER9vjY) as an inspiration. Run it using:

```shell
zig build -Drelease-safe=true run
```

**Dependencies:**

- SDL2 and SDL2-TTF (Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`)


## cout

In the folder `cout` you can find the game written in C. Check out the readme there on instructions how to build and run it (run the build commands in that folder then).
